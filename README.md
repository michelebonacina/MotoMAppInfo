# MotoMApp
## Motorcycle Map App - Yet another application for motorcyle map navigation.

MotoMApp is a smartphone navigation application.

I'm still developing it, but there're some useful features ready for use.

### Available features

#### Cockpit Page
The cockpit page contains information about the trip. 

It's still in development and the data on it are intended for debug purpose.

#### Map Page
There's a biker icon in the center of the map; it's your current position. While moving, the top view visualition rotate and scroll around the biker orienting the map in the same direction of the real world.
